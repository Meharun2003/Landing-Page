      <p>
	Squirrels are generally small rodents with slender bodies, bushy tails and large eyes.
	In general, their fur is short, soft and silky, and ranges in thickness from species to species. 
	The color of their fur is also highly variable and can be whitish, gray, yellow, red, brown, or even black.
	The average lifespan of a squirrel ranges between 5 to 10 years, but some species can survive up to 10 to 20 years. </p>
